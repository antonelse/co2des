## **Features**
+ **Automatic visual generation**
  The resulting visual is completely generated by the attendants. Every user interaction contributes to generate new elements of the visual, based on the chosen category of parameters. The elements interact with each other to create more complex shapes and sometimes even novel elements.

+ **Evolutionary system to change the executed code**
  When user generated features interact with each other they can make the system evolve and generate new elements which will effectively change some parameters in the code executed by the live coder.

+ **Immediate and easy to use Web App**
  Every attendant can easily interact with the performance simply by connecting to a web app deployed on PythonAnywhere - [link](https://wemakethings.pythonanywhere.com/)

+ **Chat-style user interaction visualization**
  Every message sent by the participants will be visualized in a chat-style fashion, showing the usernames, the parameters they have chosen and the values they would like to assign.

+ **Live coder executed code block visualization**
  One of the principles of live coding is "showing the code", so every code block executed by the coder will be clearly visualized in a defined part of the screen.

## **Prerequisites**
This app is base on different software. To use the entire functionalities you have to install the following software:
+ Processing - [link]()
+ TidalCycles -
+ Atom -

### Processing Dependencies
Before running the Processing script, you have to install these libraries:
+ _oscP5_ - [link](http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/oscP5/)
+ _netP5_ - [link](http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/oscp5/reference/netP5/package-summary.html)
+ _processing.sound_ - [link](https://processing.org/reference/libraries/sound/)
+ _http.request_ - [link](https://github.com/runemadsen/HTTP-Requests-for-Processing)


## **How To**
### configure the machine
The most difficult part is the TidalCycles environment installation.
Please, refere to [this]() link.
### configure the text editor
The full app functionalities was tested only coding with the [Atom] text editor.
Unfortunately, we had to "hack" the original [TidalCycle]() package for Atom.

## Known Issue
+ **macOs microphone permission** - [link](https://github.com/processing/processing-sound/issues/51#issuecomment-622929461)

+ **superCollider "late" messages** - [link](https://github.com/musikinformatik/SuperDirt/blob/develop/superdirt_startup.scd)

## Example Use

## Hack The System
+ change the scree size
+ different parameter mapping
