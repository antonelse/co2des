# **co2des**

**_co2des_** is an environment for enhanced live coding performances.
It can be considered as an interactive artistic installation in which the most important part is the audience.
It is based on the concept of making the people able to interact with the system so that they are active part of the creative process.
The live coder executes some code to generate the music leaving some parameter free, they are filled thanks to the user interactions.
The interaction is made through a web app and sent to the system.
The people are able to see the result in a visual, better if projected on a big screen, and obviously listening to the changes in the sound.

## **Prerequisites**
This app is base on different software. To use the entire functionalities you have to install the following software:
+ Processing - [link]()
+ TidalCycles -
+ Atom -

### Processing Dependencies
Before running the Processing script, you have to install ...


## **How To**
### configure the machine
The most difficult part is the TidalCycles environment installation.
Please, refere to [this]() link.
### configure the text editor
The full app functionalities was tested only coding with the [Atom] text editor.
Unfortunately, we had to "hack" the original [TidalCycle]() package for Atom.

## Known Issue
